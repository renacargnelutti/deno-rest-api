# deno-rest-api

To run the project you have to install Deno first: [here](https://deno.land/#installation)

After that you will be able to run the project located on root folder (The param -A es only for development and it allows every permission):
```sh
> deno run -A index.ts
```

This project is in progress. I'm started with a simple structure.
I'm going to add some extra features like database integration and dokcer.

Project based on: [Dev.to link](https://dev.to/kryz/write-a-small-api-using-deno-1cl0)
